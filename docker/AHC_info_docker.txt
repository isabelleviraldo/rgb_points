*****All of the files here require AHC AHC_node to be running*****

If AHC is downloaded, in a new terminal on your device, go to where it is stored. 
Then colcon build it and run it using $ ros2 run AHC AHC_node, so long as a ros2 
is running with lidar and zed camera info, these programs can work and you can go
to the MENU to run the code.

-or-

If AHC is NOT downloaded, go to the following github file and download it, its a
Dockerfile specifically to run AHC AHC_node, once built using docker, follow its
instructions in the READ_ME
