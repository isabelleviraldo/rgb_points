To run the code, do once: $ ros2 run rgb_points <choose from below>

All of these need lidar and video feed, and AHC_node MUST be running
(do $ cat AHC_info.txt to find out more about AHC_node)

cp_v1       --> first attempt to color the point cloud (MUST PLAY AHC AHC_node)
cp_new_math --> fixed the math from version 1, but somehow *worse???* (MUST PLAY AHC AHC_node)
cp_center   --> colors the objects detected based off of the centerpoint of the object (MUST PLAY AHC AHC_node)
cp_few_colors  --> colors every 50 points within an object the same color (MUST PLAY AHC AHC_node)
