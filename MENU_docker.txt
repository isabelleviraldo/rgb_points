to run the code, do once: $ ros2 run rgb_points <option>

all of these need lidar and video feed, so run a ROS2 bag file

read_pcl   --> reads point cloud published by lidar
read_img   --> reads immage published by lidar
read_obj   --> reads point cloud published by AHC AHC_node (MUST BE PLAYING TO SEE)
test_math  --> quickly tests math being used < you dont really ever need this, just testing

color_points_v1   --> first attempt to color the point cloud
color_points_new_math --> fixed the math from version 1, but somehow *worse???*
color_points_center   --> colors the objects detected based off of the centerpoint of the object (MUST PLAY AHC AHC_node)
garbage_fire_testing  --> my main testing file, currently is coloring every 50 points within an object the same color (MUST PLAY AHC AHC_node)
